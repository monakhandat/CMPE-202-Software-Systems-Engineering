Design Patterns used:

State Pattern:
In this scenario, the NotifyCustomer executes different behaviors according to the TableQueue State. If the state returned by TableQueue is unavailable, then the Waitlist will perform addToWaitlist operation and the state will get changed to unavailable, and if the state returned is available then Waitlist will perform removeFromWaitlist operation followed by allocateTable operation and the state will change to available. In this State design pattern, a Waitlist objectâ€™s behavior is the result of state returned by TableQueue, and the behavior gets changed at runtime according to the state.

Singleton Pattern:
NotifyCustomer handles all issues like allocating table, adding customers to waiting list. This pattern makes instantiation of class to one object of NotifyCustomer and it handles all work. Therefore, single configuration handler is NotifyCustomer here.
