# Design Pattern Implemented - Strategy  
  
  In this lab, square and cube of a number is printed on entering the number.  
  ## List of classes-  
  1. StrategyMain- Main function that calls calculation function to calculate square and cube.  
  2. IStrategyPattern- Interface for strategy design pattern with calculation method.  
  3. Square- Class that implements IStrategyPattern with calculaion method to find square of integer.  
  4. Cube- Class that implements IStrategyPattern with calculaion method to find cube of integer.  
  5. StrategyWithLambda- Main function using Lambda expressions that uses IStrategyPattern and not Square and Cube classes.
